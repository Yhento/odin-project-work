Commands related to a remote repository:
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

Commands related to the workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Commands related to checking status or log history
git status
git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;

git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and

git status is read as git | status | (no destination). 1

git push -u origin main - Set the default push behavior of your git project

git remote add origin REMOTE-URL - Connect to a github repository

git remote -v  - Test connection to the above!
